## READING RESPONSES

* upload reading responses as a Word Doc to the Slack channel in which I've posted the reading 
* VERY IMPORTANT: name your reading response document with your last name, then first name, then reading title. 
	* For example: _Seegers, Jesse - Wertheimer reading response.doc_

Answer the following questions:

* The most important point(s) (or the most useful or valuable thing(s) you learned) from the reading, and why.
* The most confusing points, and why they were confusing.
* How the material connects with or breaks from your prior knowledge or how it connects with your knowledge from other courses
