## SHOW & TELLS

#### CREATOR SHOW & TELLS
* Pair up w/ 1 classmate
* Select an artist, designer, or collective from the list below.
* Specific show & tell due dates are outlined in the schedule at the end of the syllabus and on basecamp.
* Check out at least one book from the NYU library (or library of your choice) which contains images of the work of your chosen artist, designer, or collective, and bring it to class. 
* Each team member should bring in at least 3 or more digitized examples of the work of your chosen artist, designer, or collective for a total of at least 6 images.
* Be familiar with a brief bio (or overview) and be prepared to CRITICALLY discuss your assigned artist, designer, or collective and their supporting work in an engaging presentation in front of the class. 
* In addition to telling the class the more factual aspects of the creator's biography and the work for which they are known, I also want you to state your own opinion or interpretation of the work: whether you like it or not, what it means to **you**, your own opinions.


#### LOGO SHOW & TELLS

* Create a **7 minutes or less** presentation (pdf, powerpoint, keynote, quicktime, etc.) that shows and discusses the history of the evolution of the logo. 
* You should find out the name of the logo designer (if you can), the dates that the logo was redesigned, and why it was redesigned.
* Cite your sources
* Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools)
