## TICKETS TO LEAVE


Each class period, before you leave write a direct message to me in the class Slack channel, answering **BOTH** of the following questions:

* What are the three most important points you learned today in class?
* What concept(s) confuses you from today’s lecture or exercises? (This will give you a clue as to what you should study before the next class.)
