## PROJECT: PHYSICAL APPLICATION (PA)
Your final logo in color in a physical, applied state (i.e. poster, packaging, signage, apparel, business cards, stickers, etc.). Your choice for your logo’s applied state is up to you. You decide. There are literally hundreds of possible applied states. 

**Fall 2017 DUE DATES:**
- 1st Draft: November 2, 2017
- 2nd Draft: November 9, 2017

- Final Draft: December 14, 2017


#### PA 1st Draft    
Post on your class website in grayscale (includes black and white) with physapp1 category or tag.

* Select 1 applied state for your one and true final logo
* For that selected applied state only, do at least 3 different directions 
* In other words, if you are going to do a cd cover, all 3 different versions should be for a cd cover. If you are doing a business card, all 3 different versions should be for a business card. 
* Each version in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)
* Select only 1 applied state (yes, this is repeated.)
* The versions should NOT be for different applied states such as 1 for an album cover, tattoos, and yet another for a T-Shirt design.

#### PA 2nd Draft    
Post on your class website in grayscale (includes black and white) or color with physapp2 category or tag.

* Choose the version selected in the previous class crit.
* Do at least 3 different variations of the selected PA. 
* Each variation in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)

#### PA Final    
Get your final physical application printed at a service bureau of your choice.
