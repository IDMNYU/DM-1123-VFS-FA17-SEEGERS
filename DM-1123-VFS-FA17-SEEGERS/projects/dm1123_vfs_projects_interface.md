## PROJECT: INTERFACE
Using a combination of Illustrator and/or IndDesign, apply your brand to a digital interface of your choice (game, website, mobile application, etc).

#### INTERFACE Draft 1 - Wireframes    
Post on your wordpress in grayscale (includes black and white) with interface-wireframes category. 

* Create a wireframe of your interface in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11). 
  * Include a sitemap in grayscale (includes black and white) with interface-wireframes category. 
* Every single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 
* For this draft, use dummy text (Lorem Ipsum) for text. Use Real Text.


#### INTERFACE Draft 2  
* Create 3 different versions of your interface as high fidelity wireframes, with your sample content (text and images) in color
* Post on your class website with an inteface-hifi-wireframe
* Do not use Lorem Ipsum for text. Use Real Text.


#### INTERFACE Final Draft
* Refine selection
* Post a clickable prototype on your class website with an inteface-final category (or on basecamp. If you post on basecamp, link to your basecamp message from wordpress).
  * Consult the readings and/or VFS <a href="../dm1123_vfs_recommended_resources.md">resources</a> page for applications to use for prototypes.
