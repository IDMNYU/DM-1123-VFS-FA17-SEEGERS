## IDM COURSEWORK DOCUMENTATION

* Set up your class website using wordpress at http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/~yourfirstnamelastname/vf
* Add your blog URL to [this google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JlMH6wbC-oGBbtuYbK_uHi4SKegyMFjTVt9Bj6t88j4/edit?usp=sharing) 

IDM would like to begin archiving all student coursework. We would like all students to document their IDM coursework on sites.bxmc.poly.edu. We want you to archive on sites.bxmc.poly.edu because these are IDM servers. If your work is archived on your personal servers, there is a possibility that you would delete your archives after they graduate or even sooner.

Pleas go to the session to set up your IDM server space on Friday, February 3, from 1-5PM in MAGNET room 811
