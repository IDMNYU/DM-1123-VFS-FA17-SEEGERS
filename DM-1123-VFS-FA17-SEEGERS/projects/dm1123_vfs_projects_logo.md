## PROJECT: LOGO
Create a logo for your made up brand in Adobe Illustrator.

####Decide on your Brand, Organization, Company, etc.
* Choose 4-6 letters and/or numbers
* It cannot be a real life brand, you have to make it up:
    * Make up what it is - a company? an organization? a student club? or a 
* It can be an acronym, as in, it can stand for something that you make up, but you’re designing the logo mark for the 4-6 letters
* write a few sentences describing the brand/organization/company, things like its name (does it go by an abbreviation, like NYU?), what it does, who its audience is, etc.

####Preparation
* Upload to the Slack Channel "project-logo"
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description (1 to 2 sentences max) of what your logo is for to your wordpress post


####LOGO 1st Draft  
* **At least 10 different versions of logo** iterations of your selected brand **ALL in grayscale (this includes black &amp; white)**
* One logo per 8 1/2 x 11" (letter) papers dimensions for a total of at least 20 images
  * A big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner
* at least 3 should be digital
* at least 3 should be haptic (non-digital) 
  * You will need to digitize haptic files (i.e. scan or take a digital photo, etc.)
* Also, consider creating haptic / digital combos
* If it helps, refer to the [different type of logos](http://www.logodesignsource.com/types.html
    * Iconic/symbolic
    * Wordmark
    * Combination of symbol/icon and text
* It could also be a redesign of an existing personal logo. If so, please post the original logo as well

#### LOGO 2nd Draft  
* Choose 3 of your 10 different ideas to continue working on
* Do at least **5 different logo iterations** of each version selected in the previous class crit.
* One logo per letter dimensions ( 8 1/2 x 11) for a total of at least 15 page
* For each version, make a big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner)

#### LOGO Final  
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description (1 to 2 sentences max) of what your logo is for to your wordpress post
* In order to come to your final logo, you will have to do many more iterations of your selected logo version. I would like to see the iterations you made to get to your final logo, as well.
* **Final logo** in color and letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11) with a big version vs. a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the corner
